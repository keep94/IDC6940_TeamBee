M. Smithson and J. Verkuilen, A better lemon-squeezer? Maximum likelihood regression with beta-distribuited
dependent variables Psycholog. Meth. 11 (2006), pp. 54â€“71.


Introduction starts out with reading test scores, N=44 based on IQ and whether or not the child is dyslexic. The scores are converted to (0, 1) using linear transformation. Using conventional linear regression with a logit transformation, shows that IQ alone does not affect reading score, which is not actually the case.

The article introduces beta distribution and discuses the transformation of the shape parameters into $\mu$ and $\phi$. 

The article talks fitting linear models to $logit(\mu)$ and $ln(\phi)$

$$
logit(\mu_i) = x_i\beta
$$
$$
ln(\phi_i) = -w_i\delta
$$

W and X are different shape vectors from the data where the first column of each are all 1's. 

So this answers my previous question. Depending on the model chosen, $\phi$ can be constant or it can vary depending on regressors.
